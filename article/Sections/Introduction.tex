\chapter{Introduction}


\section{Motivation}
Friction is the force that prevents the relative motion of objects in contact.
From our everyday life, we recognize it as the inherent resistance to sliding
motion. Some surfaces appear slippery and some rough, and we know intuitively
that sliding down a snow-covered hill is much more exciting than its grassy
counterpart. Without friction, it would not be possible to walk across a flat
surface, lean against the wall without falling over or secure an object by the
use of nails or screws [p. 5]~\cite{gnecco_meyer_2015}. It is probably safe to
say that the concept of friction is integrated into our everyday life to such an
extent that most people take it for granted. However, the efforts to control
friction date back to the early civilization (3500 B.C.) with the use of the
wheel and lubricants to reduce friction in translational
motion~\cite{bhushan_2013}. Today, friction is considered a part of the wider
field \textit{tribology} derived from the Greek word \textit{tribos} meaning
``rubbing'' and includes the science of friction, wear and
lubrication~\cite{bhushan_2013}. The most compelling motivation to study
tribology is ultimately to gain full control of friction and wear for various
technical applications. Especially, reducing friction is of great interest as
this has advantages for energy efficiency. It has been reported that
tribological problems have a significant potential for economic and
environmental improvements~\cite{kim_nano-scale_2009}:
\begin{quote}
    ``On global scale, these savings would amount to 1.4\% of the GDP annually
    and 8.7\% of the total energy consumption in the long
    term.''~\cite{holmberg_influence_2017}. 
\end{quote}
On the other hand, the reduction of friction is not the only sensible
application for tribological studies. Controlling frictional properties, besides
minimization, might be of interest in the development of a grasping robot where
finetuned object handling is required. While achieving a certain ``constant''
friction response is readily obtained through appropriate material choices, we
are yet to unlock the full capabilities to alter friction dynamically on the go.
One example from nature inspiring us to think along these lines are the gecko
feet. More precisely, the Tokay gecko has received a lot of attention in
scientific studies aiming to unravel the underlying mechanism of its
``togglable'' adhesion properties. Although geckos can produce large adhesive
forces, they retain the ability to remove their feet from an attachment surface
at will~\cite{Gekko}. This makes the gecko able to achieve a high adhesion on
the feet when climbing a vertical surface while lifting them for the next step
remains relatively effortless. For a grasping robot, we might consider an analog
frictional concept of a surface material that can change from slippery to rough
on demand depending on specific tasks; Slippery and smooth when interacting with
people and rough and firmly gripping when moving heavy objects.


In recent years an increasing amount of interest has gone into the studies of
the microscopic origin of friction, due to the increased possibilities in
surface preparation and the development of nanoscale experimental methods.
Nano-friction is also of great concern for the field of nano-machining where the
frictional properties between the tool and the workpiece dictate machining
characteristics~\cite{kim_nano-scale_2009}. With concurrent progress in
computational capacity and development of Molecular Dynamics (\acrshort{MD}),
numerical investigations serve as an invaluable tool for getting insight into
the nanoscale mechanics associated with friction. This simulation-based approach
can be considered as a ``numerical experiment'' enabling us to create and probe
a variety of high-complexity systems which are still out of reach for modern
experimental methods.

In materials science such \acrshort{MD}-based numerical studies have been used
to explore the concept of so-called \textit{metamaterials} where the material
compositions are designed meticulously to enhance certain physical
properties~\mbox{\cite{PhysRevLett.121.255304, PhysRevResearch.2.042006,
graphene/hBN, Mao, Yang, Forte}}. This is often achieved either by intertwining
different material types or removing certain regions completely. In recent
papers by Hanakata et al.~\cite{PhysRevLett.121.255304,
PhysRevResearch.2.042006}, numerical studies have showcased that the mechanical
properties of a graphene sheet, yield stress and yield strain, can be altered
through the introduction of so-called \textit{Kirigami} inspired cuts into the
sheet. Kirigami is a variation of origami where the paper is cut additionally to
being folded. While these methods originate as an art form, aiming to produce
various artistic objects, they have proven to be applicable in a wide range of
fields such as optics, physics, biology, chemistry and
engineering~\cite{chen_kirigamiorigami_2020}. Various forms of stimuli enable
direct 2D to 3D transformations through folding, bending, and twisting of
microstructures. While original human designs have contributed to specific
scientific applications in the past, the future of this field is highly driven
by the question of how to generate new designs optimized for certain physical
properties. However, the complexity of such systems and the associated design
space makes for seemingly intractable\footnote{In computer science we define an
\textit{intractable} problem as a problem with no \textit{efficient} algorithm
to solve it nor any analytical solutions. The only way to solve such problems is
the \textit{brute-force} approach, simply trying all possible solutions, which
is often beyond the capabilities of computational resources.} problems ruling
out analytic solutions.

Earlier architecture design approaches such as bioinspiration, looking at gecko
feet for instance, and Edisonian, based on trial and error, generally rely on
prior knowledge and an experienced designer~\cite{Mao}. While the Edisonian
approach is certainly more feasible through numerical studies than real-world
experiments, the number of combinations in the design space rather quickly
becomes too large for a systematic search, even when considering the computation
time on modern-day hardware. However, this computational time constraint can be
relaxed by the use of machine learning (\acrshort{ML}) which has proven
successful in the establishment of a mapping from the design space to physical
properties of interest. This gives rise to two new styles of design approaches:
One, by utilizing the prediction from a trained network we can skip the
\acrshort{MD} simulations altogether resulting in an \textit{accelerated search}
of designs. This can be further improved by guiding the search accordingly to
the most promising candidates, for instance, as done with the \textit{genetic
algorithm} based on mutation and crossing of the best candidates so far. Another
more sophisticated approach is through generative methods such as
\textit{Generative Adversarial Networks} (\acrshort{GAN}) or diffusion models.
The latter is being used in state-of-the-art AI systems such as OpenAI's
DALL$\sq$E2~\cite{DALLE} or Midjourney~\cite{Midjourney}. By working with a
so-called \textit{encoder-decoder} network structure, one can build a model that
reverses the prediction process. This is often referred to as \textit{reverse
design}, where the model predicts a design from a set of physical target
properties. In the papers by Hanakata et al.~\cite{PhysRevLett.121.255304,
PhysRevResearch.2.042006} both the \textit{accelerated search} and the
\textit{inverse design} approach was proven successful to create novel
metamaterial Kirigami designs with the graphene sheet. 

Hanakata et al.\ attributes the variation in mechanical properties to the
non-linear effects arising from the out-of-plane buckling of the sheet. Since it
is generally accepted that the surface roughness is of great importance for
frictional properties it can be hypothesized that Kirigami-induced out-of-plane
buckling can also be exploited for the design of frictional metamaterials. For
certain designs, we might hope to find a relationship between the stretching of
the sheet and frictional properties. If significant, this could give rise to an
adjustable friction behavior beyond the point of manufacturing. For instance,
the grasping robot might apply such a material as artificial skin for which
stretching or relaxing of the surface could result in a changeable friction
strength.

In addition, the Kirigami graphene properties can be explored through a
potential coupling between the stretch and the normal load, through a
nanomachine design, with the aim of altering the friction coefficient. This
invites the idea of non-linear friction coefficients which might in theory also
take on negative values. The latter would constitute a rare property only found
a few cases. These are mainly for the unloading phase of adhesive
surfaces~\cite{deng_adhesion-dependent_2012} or the loading phase of particular
heterojunction materials~\cite{Liu_2020, Mandelli_2019}.

To the best of our knowledge, Kirigami has not yet been implemented to alter the
frictional properties of a nanoscale system. However, in a recent paper by
Liefferink et al.~\cite{LIEFFERINK2021101475} it is reported that macroscale
Kirigami can be used to dynamically control the macroscale roughness of a
surface through stretching. They reported that the roughness change led to a
changeable frictional coefficient by more than one order of magnitude. This
supports the idea that Kirigami designs can be used to alter friction, but we
believe that taking this concept to the nanoscale would involve a different set
of governing mechanisms and thus contribute to new insight in this field.

\section{Goals}\label{sec:goals} In this thesis, we investigate the prospects of
altering the frictional properties of a graphene sheet through the application
of Kirigami-inspired cuts and stretching of the sheet. With the use of molecular
dynamics (\acrshort{MD}) simulations, we evaluate the frictional properties of
various Kirigami designs under different physical conditions. Based on the
\acrshort{MD} results, we investigate the possibility to use machine learning
for the prediction of frictional properties and subsequently using the model for
an accelerated search of new designs. The main goals of the thesis can be
summarized as follows.
\begin{enumerate} 
    \item Design an \acrshort{MD} simulation procedure to evaluate the
    frictional properties of a Kirigami graphene sheet under specified physical
    conditions.
    \item Develop a numerical framework to generate various Kirigami designs,
    both by seeking inspiration from macroscale designs and by the use of a
    random walk based algorithm.
    \item Investigate the frictional behavior under varying load and stretch for
    different Kirigami designs.
    \item Develop and train a machine learning model to predict the
    \acrshort{MD} simulation result and perform an accelerated search of new
    designs with the scope of optimizing certain frictional properties.
\end{enumerate}




% In the study by Hanakata et al~\cite{PhysRevResearch.2.042006} they used a
% machine learning (ML) approach to overcome the complexity of the nonlinear
% effects arising from the out-of-plane buckling which made them successfully
% map the cutting patterns to the mechanical properties of yield and stress. The
% dataset used for the ML training was generated by molecular dynamics (MD)
% simulations for a limited set of cut configurations. By training a neural
% network the MD simulations could effectively be skipped altogether making for
% an accelerated search through new cut configurations for certain mechanical
% properties. By setting up a MD simulation that quantifies the frictional
% properties of the graphene sheet we aim to make an analog study regarding the
% search for certain frictional properties. 

% We will take this one step further by creating a GAN network that utilizes the
% latter network for creating an inverse design framework. That is, a network
% that takes frictional properties as input and returns the corresponding cut
% configuration. By having such a tool we can execute a targeted search for
% exotic frictional properties. Particularly, we are interested in nonlinear and
% possibly even negative friction coefficients. Friction is essentially observed
% to increase with increasing load on the frictional surface, and we often
% describe this as having a positive friction coefficient. However, if we are
% able to couple the stretching of the sheet with friction we might be able to
% break this barrier for the coefficient. By imagining some nanomachine that
% translates downward pressure into either compression or expansion of the
% altered graphene, we could have a coupling between downward pressure and
% stretch of the sheet. In that case, a friction force depending on stretch
% could effectively be made to decrease with an increasing load which would
% correspond to a negative friction coefficient following this definition
% (formulate such that we do not imply free acceleration from anything).

% One of the features of inverse design, separating it from the general class of
% ML approaches are that we do not depend on trusting the ML predictions. While
% a standard neural network might be extremely efficient on a certain prediction
% task we have usually no information on how these predictions are based. We say
% that the internal workings of the network are a black box beyond our capacity
% for interpretation. However, for the inverse design problem, we are prompted
% with a few promising design proposals which can immediately be tested in the
% MD simulations which we will regard as the most reliable predictor in this
% setting. Hence, if arriving at a successful design in alignment with our
% search prompt, we can disregard any uncertainty in the network. In that case,
% the remaining gap to bridge is that of the MD simulation and real-life
% implementations. 


% The good thing about the process of inverse design is that the uncertainty and
% missing information from the network (black box) is not important if we are
% able to locate a working design. Thus we can test the suggested design and
% remove the doubt of whether this is a good design or not. Thus we do not have
% to trust the network prediction at all. However, if the predictions are not
% accurate enough we will most likely never get any useful designs from the ML
% process, but at least we will be informed whether the designs are good or bad
% in the end with respect to the simulations. However, the question is rather if
% we can trust the simulation results. In the end, we should test the designs in
% real life to be completely sure and thus the certainty of the quality of any
% proposed designs is determined by the simulation quality. 


% On the topic of theoretical/physical understanding benefits of using ML for
% design proposals. Since a successful ML search or inverse design procedure
% will not immediately grant any physical insight this does not necessarily
% exclude physical understanding as a possible benefit. When solving design
% problems scientists often seek inspiration from nature, i.e.\ biological
% solutions build from the greatest and probably most complex parameter
% optimization search ever recorded, evolution. Let it be that of Gekko feet or
% XXX. By studying the working mechanism of biological systems we can unravel
% exotic mechanisms which can be exploited for artificial/human build
% contraptions. Similarly, we can consider the output of a successful ML
% framework similar to that of evolution. We are not immediately granted a
% physical explanation for its working, but we now have a case study for which
% we can seek to understand this behavior. 

% Defining the goal of the thesis and restrictions Make bullet point objectives
% for the thesis and state which is completed, which is perhaps not conclusive
% and which I did not answer at all. Perhaps also make a list of
% problems/questions to answer (also state which one I actually answer here).


% Generally we want to contribute to the understanding of nanoscale friction
% while finding kirigami designs associated with exotic friction properties.
% This also serves as a proof of concept for future work in this direction,
% perhaps with some more clearly defined applications in mind. 




\section{Contributions}
By working towards the goals outlined above (\cref{sec:goals}), I have
discovered a non-linear relationship between the kinetic friction and the strain
for certain Kirigami patterns. This phenomenon was found to be associated with
the out-of-plane buckling of the Kirigami sheet but with no clear relationship
to the contact area or the tension in the sheet. I found that this method does
not provide any mechanism for a reduction in friction, in comparison to a
non-cut sheet, but the straining of certain Kirigami sheets allows for a
non-monotonic increase in friction. The relationship to normal load was proven
negligible in this context and I have demonstrated that a coupled system of load
and strain (through sheet tension) can exhibit a negative friction coefficient
in certain load ranges. Moreover, I have created a dataset of roughly 10,000
data points for assessing the employment of machine learning and accelerated
search of Kirigami designs. I have found, that this approach might be useful,
but it requires an extended dataset in order to produce reliable results for a
search of new designs.

During our investigations, I have built three numerical tools, beyond the
regular scripts associated with data analysis, which can be found on
Github~\cite{Github}. The tools are summarized in the following. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item I have written a LAMMPS-based~\cite{LAMMPS} tool for simulating and
    measuring the frictional properties of a graphene sheet sliding on a
    substrate. The code is generally made flexible concerning the choice of
    sheet configuration, system size, simulation parameters and \acrshort{MD}
    potentials, which makes it applicable for further studies within this topic.
    I have also built an automized procedure to carry out multiple simulations
    under varying parameters by submitting jobs to a computational cluster via
    an ssh connection. This was done by adding minor additions to the python
    package developed by E. M. Nordhagen~\cite{lammps_simulator}.
    \item I have generated a Python-based tool for generating Kirigami patterns
    and exporting these in a compatible format with the simulation software. The
    generation of molecular structures is done with the use of
    ASE~\cite{ase-paper}. Our software includes two classes of patterns inspired
    by macroscale designs and a random walk algorithm which allow for a variety
    of different designs through user-defined biases and constraints. Given our
    system size of choice, the first two pattern generators are capable of
    generating on the order of \num{e8} unique designs while the random walk
    generator allows for significantly more. 
    \item I have built a machine learning tool based on
    Pytorch~\cite{NEURIPS2019_9015} which includes setting up the data loaders,
    a convolutional network architecture, a loss function, and general
    algorithms for training and validating the results. Additionally, I have
    written several scripts for performing grid searches and analyzing the model
    predictions in the context of the frictional properties of graphene. 
\end{itemize}
All numerical implementations used for this thesis have been originally
developed for the purpose with the exception of the usage of libraries as
mentioned above and commonly known Python libraries such as Numpy and
Matplotlib.

\section{Thesis structure}
The thesis is divided into two parts. In~\cref{part:theory} we introduce the
relevant theoretical background, and in~\cref{part:simulations} we present the
numerical implementations and the results of this thesis.

\cref{part:theory} contains a description of the theoretical background related
to Friction (\cref{chap:friction}), Molecular Dynamics (\cref{chap:MD}) and
Machine Learning (\cref{chap:ML}). In~\cref{sec:research_questions} we fill
formulate our research questions n the light of the friction theory.  

In~\cref{part:simulations}, we begin by presenting our definition and setting up
of the systemm in~\cref{chap:system}. This includes the \acrshort{MD}
simulations and the generation of Kirigami designs. This is followed by a pilot
study in~\cref{chap:pilot_study} where we evaluate the simulation results for
various physical conditions and compare a non-cut sheet to two different
Kirigami designs. Further explorations of the Kirigami configurations are
carried out in~\cref{chap:dataset_study} which includes the generation of a
dataset and the employment of machine learning and an accelerated search. We use
the results from the pilot study to demonstrate the possibility to achieve a
negative friction coefficient for a system with coupled load and strain
in~\cref{chap:negative_coef}. Finally, we summarize our results and provide an
outlook for further studies in~\cref{chap:summary}. Additional figures are shown
in~\cref{sec:sheet_stretch}, \cref{sec:dataset_conf} and~\cref{sec:data_stretch_profiles}.
