\section{Motivation}
Friction is a fundamental force that takes part in most of all interactions with
physical matter. Even though the everyday person might not be familiar with the
term \textit{friction} we recognize it as the inherent resistance to sliding
motion. Some surfaces appear slippery and some rough, and we know intuitively
that sliding down a snow covered hill is much more exciting than its grassy
counterpart. Without friction, it would not be possible to walk across a flat
surface, lean against the wall without falling over or secure an object by the
use of nails or screws [p. 5] \cite{gnecco_meyer_2015}. It is probably safe to
say that the concept of friction is integrated in our everyday life to such an
extent that most people take it for granted. However, the efforts to control
friction dates back to the early civilization (3500 B.C.) with the use of the
wheel and lubricants to reduce friction in translational motion
\cite{bhushan_2013}. Today, friction is considered a part of the wider field
\textit{tribology} derived from the Greek word \textit{Tribos} meaning
``rubbing'' and includes the science of friction, wear and lubrication
\cite{bhushan_2013}. The most compelling motivation to study tribology in
general is ultimately to gain full control of friction and wear for various
technical applications. Especially, reducing friction is of great interest as
this has tremendous advantages for energy effeciency. It has been reported that
tribological problems have a significant potential for economic and
environmental improvements \cite{kim_nano-scale_2009}:
\begin{quote}
    ``On global scale, these savings would amount to 1.4\% of the GDP annually
    and 8.7\% of the total energy consumption in the long term.''
    \cite{holmberg_influence_2017}. 
\end{quote}
On the other hand, the reduction of friction is not the only sensible
application for tribological studies. Controlling frictional properties besides
minimization might be of interest in the development of a grasping robot where a
finetuned object handling is required. While achieving a certain ``constant''
friction response is readily obtained through appropiate material choices during
manufacturing, we are yet to unlock the capabilities to alter friction
dynamically on the go. One example from nature inspiring us to think along
theese lines are the gecko feet. More precisely, the Tokay gecko has recieved a
lot of attention in scientific studies aiming to unravel the underlying
mechanism of its ``togglable'' adhesion properties. Although geckos are able to
produce large adhesive forces, they retain the ability to remove their feet from
an attachment surface at will \cite{Gekko}. This makes the gecko able to achieve
a high adhesion on the feet when climbing a vertical surface while lifting it
for the next step remains reletively effortless. For a grasping robot we might
consider an analog frictional concept of a surface material that can change from
slippery to rough on demand depending on specific tasks.

% gripping when handling heavy objects.

In the recent years an increasing amount of interest has gone into the studies
of the microscopic origin of friction, due to the increased possibilities in
surface preperation and the development of nanoscale experimental methods.
Nano-friction is also of great concern for the field of nano-machining where the
frictional properties between the tool and the workpiece dictates machining
charascteristics \cite{kim_nano-scale_2009}. With concurrent progress in
computational power and devolopment of Molecular Dynamics (\acrshort{MD}),
numerical investigations serve as an extremely useful tool for getting
insight into the nanoscale mechanics associated with friction. This simulation
based approach can be considered as a ``numerical experiment'' enabling us to create and
probe a variety of high complexity system which are still out of reach for modern experimental approaches.

In materials science such \acrshort{MD}-based numerical studies have been used to explore the concept of so-called \textit{metamaterials} where material compositions are
designed meticulously to enhance certain physical properties
\cite{PhysRevLett.121.255304}\cite{PhysRevResearch.2.042006}\cite{graphene/hBN}\cite{Mao}\cite{Yang}\cite{Forte}.
This is often achieved either by intertwining different material types or
removing certain regions completely. In recent papers by Hanakata et al.\
\cite{PhysRevLett.121.255304}(2018) \cite{PhysRevResearch.2.042006}(2020)
numerical studies have showcased that mechanical properties of a graphene
sheet, in this case yield stress and yield strain, can be altered through the
introduction of so-called \textit{Kirigami} inspired cuts into the sheet. That
is, by removing atoms at certain locations on the sheet it is possible to alter
the stretchability and resistance to rupturing under tension. Kirigami is a
variation of origami where the paper is cut additionally to being folded. While
these originate as an art form aiming to produce various artistic objects, they
have proven to be applicable in a wide range of fields such as optics, physics,
biology, chemistry and engineering \cite{chen_kirigamiorigami_2020}. Various
forms of stimuli enable direct 2D to 3D transformations through folding,
bending, and twisting of microstructures. While orginal human designs may have contributed to specific scientiffic applications, the use of kirigami and
origami driven designs are highly driven by the question of how to generate new designs with optimize certain physical properties.

Earlier architecture design approaches such as bioinspiration, looking at gecko
feet for instance, and Edisonian, based on trial and error, generally rely
on prioir knowdelegde and an experienced designer \cite{Mao}. While the
Edisonian approach is certainly more feasible through numerical studies real world experiments, the number of combinations in the design space rather quickly becomes too large to search systematically, even when considering the simmulation time of modern hardware. The complexity of metamaterials like the kirigami graphene sheet additionally makes for a seemingly intractable problem meaning that analytic solutions are of the table. However, such problems can be mittigated
by the use of machine learning (\acrshort{ML}) which have proven successful in the
establishment of a connection between kirigami designs and physical
properties (\hl{Cite again?}). The recent advancements in the field of
\acrshort{ML} makes it possible to capture ever more complex patterns in data
which can be used to learn a mapping from the design space to physcial properties of interest. This gives rise to two different design approaches: One, by utilizing the prediction from a trained network we can skip
the \acrshort{MD} simulations all together resulting in an accelerated search of
designs. This can be further improved by guiding the search as for instance through a genetic algorithm where one creates new designs based
on the best candidates so far. Optinally, one could perform \acrshort{MD} simulations on the top candidates at regularly intervales to expand the dataset and improve the \acrshort{ML} model which constritute a so-called
\textit{active learing} search loop as used in \cite{PhysRevLett.121.255304}.
Secondly, an even more sophisticated approach is through generative methods such
as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). By working with a so-called
\textit{encoder-decoder} network structure, one can build a network that reverses
the prediction process. That is, the network predict a corresponding
design given a set of physical target properties. In the papers by Hanakata et
al.\ both the \textit{accelerated search} and the \textit{inverse design} was
proven successful to create novel metamaterial designs. 


Hanakata et al.\ attributes the variety in yield properties to the non-linear
effects arrising from the out-of-plane buckling of the sheet. Since it is
generally accepted that the surface roughness is of great importance for
fritional properties it can be hypothesized that the cut and stretch procedure
applied by Hanakata et al.\ can also be exploited for the design of fricitonal
metamaterials. For certain designs we might hope to find a relationship between
stretching of the sheet and frictional properties which give rise to a
contrable friction after the point of
manufacturing. For instance, the grasping robot might apply such a material as artifical skin for which stretching or relaxing of the surface could result in a changeable friction; Slippery and smooth in contact with people and rough and firmly
gripping when moving heavy objects. In addition, a possible coupling between
stretch and the normal load through a nanomachine design would allow for an
altered friction coefficient. This invites the idea of non-linear friction
coeffcients which might in theory take on negative values as well given the
right sign of the effect from stretching. The latter would constitute an
extremely rare property. This has been reported indirectly for bulk graphite by
Deng et al.\ \cite{deng_adhesion-dependent_2012} where the friction kept
increasing during the unloading phase. \hl{Check for other cases}.

To the best of our knowledge, kirigami has not yet been implemented to alter the
frictional properties on a nanoscale. In a recent paper by Liefferink
et al.\ \cite{LIEFFERINK2021101475}(2021) it is reported that macroscale
kirigami can be used to dynamically control the macroscale roughness of a
surface by stretching which was used to change the frictional coeffcient by
more than one order of magnitude. This support the idea that kirigami designs
can in fact be used to alter friction, but we believe that taking this concept
to the nanoscale would envolve a different set of underlying mechanisms and thus
contribute to new insight in this field.

\section{Approach}




% In this thesis we investigate the possibility to control the frictional
% properties of a graphene sheet by applying strategically positioned cuts to the
% sheet inspired by kirigami patterns. Kirigami is a variation of origami where
% the paper is cut additionally to being folded. Hanakata et al.\
% \cite{PhysRevResearch.2.042006} has shown that kirigami inspired cuts on a
% graphene sheet can be used to alter the yield strain and yield stress of the
% sheet. They observed that the stretching of the cutted sheet induced a
% out-of-plane buckling which serves as a key observation for the motivation of
% this thesis. It is currently well established/believed that the friction between
% two surfaces is proportional to the real microscopic contact area (source
% here?). Hence, one can hypothesize that the buckling of the sheet will affect
% the contact area and consequently the frictional properties. 


% In the study by Hanakata et al.\ \cite{PhysRevResearch.2.042006} they used a
% machine learning (ML) approach to overcome the complexity of the nonlinear
% effects arrising from the out-of-plane buckling which made them successfuly map
% the cutting patterns to the mechanical properties of yield and stress. The
% dataset used for the ML training was generated by molecular dynamics (MD)
% simulations for a limited set of cut configuration. By training a neural network the MD simiulaitons could effectively be skipped all together making for an
% accelerated search through new cut configurations for certain mechanical
% properties. By setting up a MD simulation that quantifies the frictional
% properties of the graphene sheet we aim to make an analog study regarding the
% search for certain frictional properties. 

% We will take this on step further by creating a GAN network that utilises the
% latter network for creating an inverse design framework. That is, a network that
% takes frictional properties as input and return the corresponding cut
% configuration. By having such a tool we can execute a targeted search for exotic
% frictional properties. Particularly, we are interested in nonlinear and possibly
% even negative friction coefficients. Friction is essentially observed to
% increase with increasing load on the frictional surface, and we often describe
% this as having a positive friction coefficient. However, if we are able to
% couple the stretching of the sheet with friction we might be able to break this
% barrier for the coefficient. By imagining some nanomachine which translates
% downward pressure into either compression of expansion of the altered graphene,
% we could have a coupling between downward pressure and stretch of the sheet. In
% that case, a friction force depending on stretch could effectively be made to
% decrease with increasing load which would correspond to a negative friciton
% coeffcient following this definition (formulate such that we do not imply free
% acceleration from nothing).

% One of the features from inverse design, seperating it from the general class of
% ML approaches, is that we do not depend on trusting the ML predictions. While a
% standard neural network might be extremely efficient on a certain prediciton
% task we have usually no information on how these predictions are based. We say
% that the internal workings of the network is a black box beyond our capacaity of
% interpretation. However, for the inverse design problem we are prompted with a
% few promising design propsals which can immediately be tested in the MD
% simulations which we will regard as the most reliable predictor in this setting.
% Hence, if arriving at a successful design in alignment our search prompt, we can
% disregard any uncertainty in the network. In that case the remaining gap to
% bridge is that of the MD simulation and real life implementations. 


% The good thing about the process of inverse design is that the uncertainty and
% missing information from the network (black box) is not important if we are
% able to locate a working design. Thus we can test the suggested design and
% remove the doubt of whether this is a good design or not. Thus we do not have
% to trust the network prediction at all. However, if the predictions is not
% accurate enough we will most liekely never get any usefull designs from the ML
% process, but at least we will be informed whether the designs are good or bad
% in the end with respect to the simulations. However the question is rather if
% we can trust the simulation results. In the ned we should test the designs in
% real life to be completely sure and thus the certainity of the quality of any
% proposed designs is determined by the simulation quality. 


% On the topic of theoretical/physical understanding benefit using ML for design proposals. Since a successful ML search or inverse design procedure will not immediately grant any physical insight this does not nessecarily exclude physical understanding as a possible benefit. When solving design problems scientist often seek inspiration from nature, i.e.\ biological solutions build from the greatest and probably most complex parameter optimzation search ever recorded, evolution. Let it be that of Gekko feet or XXX. By styding the working mechanism of biologcial system we can unravel exotic mechanism which can be exploited for artifcal/human build contraptions. Similar, we can consider the output of a successful ML framework similar to that of evolution. We are not immediately granted a physical explanaiton for its working, but we now have a case study for which we can seek to understand this behaviour.

Generally we want to contribute to the understadning of nanoscale friction while finding kirigami designs associated with excotic friction properties. This also serves as a proof of concept for the future work in this direction, perhaps with some more clear defined applications in mind. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design a MD simulation to evaluate the frictional properties of the
    grapehene sheet under different variations of cut patterns, stretching and
    loading, among other physical variables.
    \item Find suitable kirigami patterns which exhibit out of plane buckling under tensile load.
    \item Create a procedure for generating variaiton of the selected kirigami patterns along with random walk based cut patterns in order to create a dataset for ML training. 
    \item Train a neural network to replace the MD simulation completely.
    \item (Variation 1) Do an accelerated search using the ML network for exotic
    frictional properties such as low and friction coeffcients and a strong
    coupling between stretch and friction. 
    \item (Variation 2) Make a GAN network using the forward network in order to extract cut configuration proposals for above frictional properties.
    \item Make a nanomachine or artifical numerical setup which couples normal load and stretch with the intention of making a proof of concept for negative friction coefficients.
