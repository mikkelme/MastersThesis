Having defined our system, we carry out an initial study of the frictional properties. First, we evaluate the numerical results for a non-cut sheet in order to define suitable metrics for a numerical evaluation of friction and justify some of the default parameter choices. This provides a basis for the following study where we consider the Tetrahedron and Honeycomb Kirigami patterns as well. We conduct a more systematic investigation of the friction dependencies to temperature, sliding speed, spring constant and timestep. Finally, we consider the mean friction of all three configurations when stretched. This includes an analysis of the dependence to contact area and the friction-load curves. 


\section{Friction simulation parameters}
The \acrshort{MD} simulations we will carry out to measure friction are governed
by a small set of parameters. For the purpose of creating a machine learning we
need to standardize these parameters. This we keep most of them constant with
only a small subset of parameters being varied: sheet configuration, strain and
load. Instead of starting with the parameter selection process, we first state
the final choice in~\cref{tab:final_param}. Due to the great number of
parameters, we do not make an exhaustive search of all parameters before
deciding on the final settings. Instead, we take a basis in parameters used in
similar friction simulations~\cite{li_evolving_2016, Yoon2015MolecularDS,
liu_high-speed_2014, zhu_study_2018, ma12091425} and adjust accordingly to the
aim of getting stable measurements and reducing computation time where possible.
Parameters such as initial relaxation time, pauses and strain speed are chosen
mainly from the results of initial stability tests. The sheet and pull block
sizes are chosen with a consideration of the balance between Kirigami design
options and computational resources. The scan direction is chosen to be parallel
to the connection line between the pull blocks. This is mainly chosen in order
to avoid unessecary complexity in the motion since it can be hypethesized that the
center of the sheet can drag behind for other scan directions. The remaining
parameters: Temperature $T$, sliding speed $v_{\text{slide}}$, spring constant
$K$, normal load $F_N$, timestep $dt$ and sliding distance have been chosen
because the friction output remains relatively stable with moderate
perturbations around these default values. We will explain this in more detail
later in the chapter. Note that the default values in~\cref{tab:final_param}
will be used when nothing else is stated explicitly.

% We aim to chose the parameters in order to accomodate a balance between generlizable and stable result which is simmutaneously a suting candidate as a proof of concept for the control of friction properties using kirigami inspired cuts. 



% Due to the great number of parameters, and corresponding range of reasonable numerical values they can take, it is ... to parameter search including all of these. Thus, we will to a great extent rely on a reverse engineering in order to establish a set of parameters for the \textit{physical} and \textit{measurement} categories along with numerical ranges for the $\textit{ML input}$ category which gives stable and promising results. By doing so we effectively narrow down the parameter regime for which the investigated frictional properties belong. We aim to chose the parameters in order to accomodate a balance between generlizable and stable result which is simmutaneously a suting candidate as a proof of concept for the control of friction properties using kirigami inspired cuts. 

% In the following we present the results of the friction simulations in parallel to the procedure of investigating the choice of different parameters. 

% In the following subsections (X to Y) we are going to present the friction simulation results in parallel to the presentation of the reasoning behind the parameter choices. For this we will refer to the default parameter choice showcased in \cref{tab:final_param} which is representative of the final parameter choices. 




% The sliding velocity is 20 m/s, which is comparable to the operating conditions in micromechanical systems (MEMS), but which is much larger than the typical velocity in scanning force microscopy (SFM) experiments. \cite{mo_friction_2009} Supplementary materials.


% We should try to set the physcis and measurement parameters in such a way that we reduce computation speed where it is doesn't infer with the frictional properties study.



% Parameters expected to have a physical effect on the friction properties, which is kept fixed and thus not included in the machine learning input set. 

% Paramters influecing the simulation kinetics and being representative of the experimental procedure that we are mimicking. These parameters is chosen with the aim of getting stable parameters under small perturbations of the given parameter. 

% The remaining paramters serves as input variables for optimization process and is thus given as input variables for the machine learning (ML).




% Say someting about how these parameters is chosen. Reference to articles for which these was mirrored from. 





% We need to define some ranges for the ML input paramters. $F_N$, stretch ranges where it is not prone to ruptures. The configuration it self does not have clear rules but is also being regulated by the no rupture requirement. 

% Retardation effects due to the finiteness of the speed of sound are usually irrelevant in slow-speed experiments (v < 1 mm/s) \cite{Manini_2016}

% In macroscopic tribology experiments, sliding speeds often range in the 0.1 − 10 m/s region \cite{Manini_2016}

% By contrast, in nanoscale AFM experiments the tip usually advances at much lower speeds $\sim$ 1 $\mu$m/s: over a typical run it is possible to simulate a tiny ∼ 1 pm displacement, far too small to explore even a single atomic-scale event, let alone averaging over a steady state.\cite{Manini_2016}


% However, MD simulations can provide so much physical insight that they make sense even if carried out at much higher speeds than in real-life AFM or surface force apparatus (SFA) experiments: in practice, currently the sliding speeds of most atomistic tribology simulations are in the $\sim$ 1 m/s region.\cite{Manini_2016}


% Besides the limitations of system size and simulation times that are obvious and will be discussed later, there is another limitation concerning temperature, that is rarely mentioned. All classical frictional simulations, atomistic or otherwise, are only valid at sufficiently high temperature. They become in principle invalid at low temperatures where the mechanical degrees of freedom of solids progressively undergo ”quantum freezing”, and both mechanics and thermokinetics deviate from classical. \cite{Manini_2016}.

% Single friction simulation analysis
\section{Force traces}\label{sec:single_analysis}
We begin by assessing the friction force traces, i.e.\ force vs.\ time curves, for a single friction simulation using the default parameters shown in \cref{tab:final_param} for a non-cut sheet with
no stretch applied and a normal load of $\SI{1}{nN}$. 


\subsection{Force oscillations}\label{sec:force_oscillations}
We evaluate the friction force as the force acting on the sheet from the
substrate. We consider initially the force component $F_{\parallel}$ parallel
to the drag direction as plotted in \cref{fig:drag_Ff}. We use a sample rate of \mbox{$\SI{10}{ps^{-1}} = \SI{100}{timesteps^{-1}}$} for which each sample is the mean value of
the preceding 100 timesteps. We observe immediately that the data carries oscillations on different time scales which match our general expectations for
sliding involving periodic surfaces. By applying a Savgol filter to the data
with a polynomial order of 5 and a window length of 150 timesteps (corresponding to a
sliding distance of \SI{3}{Å} or a time window of \SI{15}{ps}) we can qualitatively point
out at least two different frequencies of oscillation. During the first 10 Å of
sliding, seen in \cref{fig:drag_Ff_10}, we see roughly three waves on the Savgol
filter corresponding to a relatively high frequency, while for the duration of
100 Å of sliding, seen in \cref{fig:drag_Ff_100}, the same Savgol filter reveals
a lower frequency on top, creating the visual pattern of a wavepacket. The data
does not indicate clear signs of stick-slip behavior as otherwise found in
other studies, e.g.\ by Zhu and Li \cite{zhu_study_2018} for graphene on gold,
who saw a more typical saw tooth shape in the force trace. Besides the difference
in the substrate material, using gold instead of silicon, they used a lower sliding
speed of \SI{10}{m/s} and a soft spring of $K = \SI{10}{N/m}$. By adopting these
parameters we get a slightly different force trace behavior as shown in
\cref{fig:drag_Ff_10_K10_v10} and \cref{fig:drag_Ff_100_K10_v10}. This change
breaks the symmetry in the force oscillations but still does not produce any
significant discontinuities in the trace. By keeping the spring constant $K =
\SI{10}{N/m}$ and lowering the sliding speed further down to \SI{1}{m/s} we are
able to demonstrate a proper stick-slip behavior as shown in
\cref{fig:drag_Ff_10_K10_v1} and \cref{fig:drag_Ff_100_K10_v1}. Considering all
three simulations we might classify the results from the default settings, $K =
\inf, v = \SI{20}{m/s}$, as smooth sliding,  $K = \SI{10}{N/m}, v =
\SI{10}{m/s}$, as a transition phase with possible occasional slipping, and $K
= \SI{10}{N/m}, v = \SI{1}{m/s}$ as certain stick-slip behaviour. This confirms the qualitative observation the stick-slip behavior is suppressed with stiff springs~\cite{bonelli_atomistic_2009} springs and high sliding velocity~\cite{liu_high-speed_2014}. Having a low sliding speed comes with a high computational cost which is the reason that we choose a relatively high sliding speed of \SI{20}{m/s}. The choice of an infinite spring constant is related to the stability of the measurements and is discussed later in this chapter \hl{make sure it is, maybe make a reference}.

     \label{fig:drag_Ff}
\end{figure}

By performing a Fourier Transform on the data, using the default parameters, we can quantify the leading frequencies observed in figure \cref{fig:drag_Ff_10} and \cref{fig:drag_Ff_100}. The Fourier transform is shown in \cref{fig:ft_a}, and by plotting the two most dominant frequencies $f_1 = \SI{0.0074}{ps^{-1}}$ and $f_2 = \SI{0.0079}{ps^{-1}}$ as a sine sum, $\sin{(2\pi f_1)} + \sin{(2\pi f_2)}$, we find a qualitatively convincing fit to the observed wavepacket shape as seen in \cref{fig:ft_b}. We can convert the frequencies according to that of a wavepacket. By using the trigonometric identity
\begin{align*}
\sin (a+b) &= \sin (a) \cos (b) + \cos (a) \sin (b), \\
\sin (a-b) &= \sin (a) \cos (b) - \cos (a) \sin (b),
\end{align*}
and decomposing the frequencies as $f_1 = a - b$, $f_2 = a + b$, we can rewrite the sine sum as the sinusoidal product
\begin{align*}
  \sin(2\pi f_1) + \sin(2\pi f_2) &= \sin\big(2\pi (a - b)\big) + \sin\big(2\pi (a + b)\big) \\
  &= \sin(2\pi a)\cos(2\pi b) + \cancel{\cos(2\pi a)\sin(2\pi b)} + \sin(2\pi a)\cos(2\pi b) - \cancel{\cos(2\pi a)\sin(2\pi b)} \\
  &= 2 \sin(2\pi a) \cos(2\pi b),
\end{align*} 
with 
\begin{align*}
  a = \frac{f_1 + f_2}{2} &= 0.0763 \pm \SI{0.0005}{ps^{-1}},& 
  b = \frac{f_2 - f_1}{2} &= 0.0028 \pm \SI{0.0005}{ps^{-1}},& \\
  &= 0.381 \pm \SI{0.003}{{\text{Å}}^{-1}},& 
  &= 0.014 \pm \SI{0.003}{{\text{Å}}^{-1}}.& 
\end{align*}
In the latter transition, we have denoted the frequency with respect to the sliding distance by considering the default sliding speed of $\SI{20}{m/s} = \SI{0.2}{\text{Å}/ps}$. This makes us recognize the high oscillation frequency as $a$ and the low frequency
as $b$. The faster one has a period of $T_a = 2.62 \pm \SI{0.02}{\text{Å}}$ \footnote{The
uncertainty $\Delta y$ is calculated as $\Delta y = \left|\frac{\partial
y}{\partial x} \Delta x \right|$ for uncertainty $\Delta x$ and $y(x)$} which
corresponds well with the magnitude of the lattice spacing and especially that of
graphene at \SI{2.46}{Å} as expected theoretically. The longer period $T_b = 71 \pm
\SI{15}{\text{Å}}$ is not obviously explained. We notice a similarly long period oscillation for all three cases \cref{fig:drag_Ff_100}, \cref{fig:drag_Ff_100_K10_v10} and \cref{fig:drag_Ff_100_K10_v1}, and thus we have no reason to believe that this is dependent on the stick-slip behavior. The initial build-up in friction force is reminiscent of friction strengthening, which is often reported~\cite{zhang_tuning_2019, li_evolving_2016}, but the periodicity goes against this idea. Instead, we might attribute it to some phonon
resonance which could be a physical phenomenon or simply a feature of our
\acrshort{MD} modeling.

\subsection{Decompositions}
In the previous analysis, we looked only at the friction force for the full
sheet, including the rigid pull blocks, and with respect to the drag direction. We found this way of measuring the friction force to be the most intuitive and reliable, but we will present the underlying arguments for this choice in the following.

Since we are only applying cuts to the inner sheet, and not the
pull blocks, it might appear more natural to only consider the friction inner sheet. If the desired frictional properties can be achieved by altering the inner
sheet one can argue that any opposing effects from the pull blocks can be
mitigated by simply scaling the relative size between the inner sheet and the pull
blocks. However, when looking at the force traces decomposed with respect to the
inner sheet and pull block regions respectively in~\cref{fig:decomp_group}, we
observe that the friction force arising from those parts is seemingly
antisymmetric. That is, the distribution of the frictional pull from the
substrate on the sheet is oscillating between the inner sheet and the pull
blocks. Keeping in mind that normal force is only applied to the pull blocks we
might take this as an intrinsic feature of the system that does not necessarily disappear with a scaling of the spatial ratio between the inner sheet and pull blocks. Any interesting friction properties might depend on this internal distribution of forces. Hence, we hedge our bets and use the full sheet friction force as a holistic approach to avoid excluding relevant information in the measurement data.

Similarly, we might question the decision of
only considering the frictional force projected onto the sliding direction as
we are then neglecting the ``side shift'' induced during sliding. In~\cref{fig:decomp_direc} we show the decomposition in terms of the force components parallel $F_{\parallel}$ and perpendicular $F_{\perp}$ to the sliding direction respectively. We notice that the most dominant trend appears for the parallel component. If we want to include the perpendicular component as well we would have to evaluate friction as the length of the force vector instead. However, this would remove the sign of the force direction and shift the mean friction force up as we see both negative and positive contributions in the parallel force trace. One option to accommodate this issue is by using the vector length for the magnitude but keeping the sign from the parallel component. However, we omit such compromises as this might make the measurement interpretation unessercary complex, and we use only the parallel component going forward.

  \label{fig:decomp}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Center of mass path}
From the previous observations of the force traces in~\cref{fig:drag_Ff} we found both smooth sliding and stick-slip behavior depending on the sliding speed and spring constant. Considering the force
decomposition in~\cref{fig:decomp_direc} we know that a frictional force in
the perpendicular direction to sliding is also present. By looking at the
$x,y$-position for the sheet Center of Mass (\acrshort{CM}) we find a qualitatively different behavior when reconsidering the spring constants and sliding speeds investigated in~\cref{fig:drag_Ff}. These results are shown in~\cref{fig:CM_path}. The default case in~\cref{fig:CM_path_def} shows a rather straight path forward with
only a small side motion in comparison to the cases in~\cref{fig:CM_path_K10_v10} and~\cref{fig:CM_path_K10_v1}. However, the \acrshort{CM} accelerates and deaccelerates with a high frequency, much too high
to be associated with the lattice spacing on the order of \SI{2.46}{Å}. One possible explanation is that the sheet and substrate
constitute an incommensurable contact for which traveling kink excitations make
the atoms move in such a way that the sheet \acrshort{CM} is incremented in small ``burst''. When looking at the $K = \SI{10}{\frac{N}{m}}$, $v =
\SI{10}{\frac{m}{s}}$ case in~\cref{fig:CM_path_K10_v10} we see a completely
different \acrshort{CM} path where the rapid movements aligns visually better with
the force oscillations shown earlier in \cref{fig:drag_Ff_100_K10_v10}. The
\acrshort{CM} accelerates forward and then deaccelerates in combination with a
side motion that leads to the \acrshort{CM} path making a loop as it slows down.
Finally we have the $K = \SI{10}{\frac{N}{m}}$, $v = \SI{10}{\frac{m}{s}}$ in~\cref{fig:CM_path_K10_v10} which is confirmed to have stick-slip behavior in~\cref{fig:drag_Ff_100_K10_v1}. Here the \acrshort{CM} path shows a more chaotic
movement between acceleration, but with the rapid parts aligning  which also visually well with the timing of the slips seen in \cref{fig:drag_Ff_100_K10_v1}. The chaotic motion is not connected to the stick-slip motion, but we might associate it with the thermal contributions being dominant in this regime.

\section{Defining metrics for friction}\label{sec:fric_metrics}
In order to evaluate the frictional properties of the sheet we aim to reduce the force trace results, addressed in section~\cref{sec:single_analysis}, into single metrics describing the kinetic and static friction respectively. 

\subsection{Kinetic friction}
We measure kinetic friction as the mean of the friction force trace. More
precisely, we take the mean value of the last half of the dataset in order to
ensure that we are sampling from a stable system. For a full sliding simulation
of \SI{400}{\text{Å}} our mean value will be founded on the last \SI{200}{\text{Å}}
(\SI{1000}{ps}) of sliding. In~\cref{fig:runmean} we have shown the force trace
for the first \SI{10}{\text{Å}} of sliding together with a 50\% running mean window.
The choice of such a short sliding distance is merely to illustrate the sampling
procedure, and we see that the final mean estimate (marked with a dot) takes a
negative value due to the specific cut-off of the few oscillations captured
here. Nonetheless, one approach to quantify the uncertainty of the final mean
estimate is to consider the variation of the running mean preceding the final
mean value. The more the running mean fluctuates the more uncertainty associated
with the final estimate. Only the running mean ``close'' to the ending should be
considered, since the first part will rely on data from the beginning of the
simulation. From the Fourier analyze in section~\cref{sec:force_oscillations} we
found the longest significant oscillation period to be $\sim \SI{71}{\text{Å}}$.
Hence, we find it reasonable to use the standard deviation (\acrshort{std}) for
the last $\sim \SI{71}{\text{Å}}$ of the running mean window to evaluate the
fluctuations. When including the full sliding length this corresponds to the
last $\sim 35 \%$ of the running mean window. We consider the \acrshort{std} as
an estimate of the absolute error and calculate the relative error by a division
of the final mean value. In~\cref{fig:runstd} we showcase a running relative
error based on the \acrshort{std}, with a window of length 35\% the mean window,
in a continuation of the illustrative case of a \SI{10}{\text{Å}} sliding
from~\cref{fig:runmean}. In this case, we get an extremely high relative error of
$\sim 257\%$, but this is consistent with the fact that the short sampling period leads to an unphysical negative value which should be associated with high uncertainty.

\end{figure}

When including the full dataset of \SI{400}{\text{Å}} of sliding, such that the \acrshort{std} window actually matches with the longest period of oscillations expected, we get a final relative error of $\sim 12 \%$ as shown in fig \cref{fig:runstd_long}. This is arguable just at the limit of an acceptable error, but as we shall see later on in~\cref{sec:load_and_stretch} this high relative error is mainly associated with the cases of low friction. When investigating different configurations under variation of load and strain we see a considerably lower relative error as the mean friction evaluates to higher values. One interpretation of this finding is simply that the oscillations in the running mean are to some degree independent of the magnitude of the friction. In that case, the relative error will spike for the low friction cases, and the absolute error might be the more reliable measure, i.e.\ using simply the \acrshort{std} without dividing by the final mean value.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Static friction} 
The maximum value is one of the common choices for addressing static friction,
even though the definition of static friction is a bit vague. When considering
the force traces in~\cref{fig:drag_Ff} we observe that the force oscillations
increase in magnitude toward a global peak at $\sim \SI{20}{\text{Å}}$. Thus,
one could be inclined to identify this peak as the maximum value associated with
the static friction force. However, as we have already clarified, this steady
increase in friction is part of a slower oscillation that repeats by a period of
$\sim \SI{71}{\text{Å}}$. By plotting the top three max values recorded during a
full \SI{400}{Å} simulation, for 30 logarithmically spaced load values in the
range $[0.1, 100]$ nN, we observe that the global max rarely falls within this
first oscillation period as shown in \cref{fig:max_dist}. Only 2 out of 30
global maxima and 4 out of 90 top three maxima can be associated with the start
of the sliding by this definition. Thus, this result suggests that our default
system does not yield a static friction response in the sense of an initial
increase in friction due to a depinning of the sheet from the static state. Some
parameter changes that might increase the likelihood of seeing a significant
static friction response are either extending the relaxation period since static
friction is theorized to increase logarithmically with
time~\cite{dieterich_1972}, or increasing the sliding force more slowly through a soft spring tethering. As an attempt to test the latter part of this hypothesis
we run a series of simulations with varying spring constant, $K\in [5, 200]$ nN
including also $K = \infty$, but keeping the relaxation time and sliding speed at
the default values. The result is shown in \cref{fig:max_vs_K} and do
not show any support for the hypothesis that a softening of the spring constant
will eventually lead to the friction maximum occurring in the first period of sliding. We note that this might be suppressed by having a too short relaxation period or a too high sliding speed (related to the initial force increase),
but due to the ambiguousness in the assessment of the static friction we will
mainly concern ourselves with the kinetic friction in the remaning of this
thesis.


% In most numerical studies \cite{bonelli_atomistic_2009, zhu_study_2018} they define static friction as the max peak or top 5\% quantile throughout the simulation and do not consern themselves with a requirement for an initial increasement toward this max. Thus, we interpret this as a measure of the force oscillation magnitude which is highly related to the stick-slip behaviour.

% We investigate the placement of the max values, i.e. the sliding distance length for which we measure the max friction force. We show the placement of the top three max values for different simulatiosn with varying normal force in \cref{fig:max_dist}. We observe immediately that only a few top three max values is measured within a full slow period of $\sim$ 71 Å. In fact many max values is measured just before the end of the simulation. This indicates that the naive approach of using the overall max value to describe the static friction coefficient might be a to naive approach. Another approach is to use the max value within a single period, but we do not really know if this period will be similar for alle cut patterns and thus this might be limiting. 



% Look into static friction when having a spring connected to the drag force with
% rather low spring constant. Maybe compare to critical sitffness in FK model.
% Some rough calculations follow here (make a note about this being a very naive
% approach to determine a suitable stiffness for static friction scenarious. In
% reality one should increase force slowly to observe this probably). When
% dragging the sheet in the y-direction we effectively have a lattice spacing
% \begin{align*}
%   a_c = a_{2,x} + B_x = a_G\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{a_G}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2a_G}{\sqrt{3}}
% \end{align*}
% for graphene lattice constant $a_G = 2.46$ Å. For the diamond silicon structure
% this is essentially equal to the lattice constant $a_D = 5.4210$ Å. This gives 
% \begin{align*}
%   \theta = \frac{a_c}{a_b} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\frac{a_G}{a_D} \approx 0.5230.
% \end{align*}
% Since we have the factor $2/\sqrt{3}$ it is safe to assume that this is a
% irrational number leadning to incommensurability. The worst case scnario of
% incommensurability (where $\theta$ equals the golden-mean, Can we get the exact
% number?) gives the minimal critical stiffness $K_c \sim 2U_0
% (\frac{\pi}{a_b})^2$, where $U_0$ is the substrate potentiual magnitude and
% $a_b$ the lattice spacing of the substrate. The potential barrier $U_0$ can be
% approximated by the work done when resisting the normal force as $\sim F_N
% a_D/2$ such that the critical stiffness can be approximated to 
% \begin{align*}
%   K_c \sim 2 F_N \frac{a_D}{2} \left(\frac{\pi}{a_D}\right)^2 = \frac{F_N}{a_D}\pi^2
% \end{align*}
% With a normal force of 1 nN we get $K_c \sim 18$ N/m. Hence, we should try a
% spring constant lower than that as qualified way of determining if this is the
% reason why we do not really see static friciton in the simulation. By plotting the max position (in terms of drag length) as a function of spring constant as seen in \cref{fig:max_vs_K} we can investigate if the concept of a critical spring constant is governing this simulation. However, as I'm writing this I'm realizing that the spring constant in the model applies to the interatomic forces and not the one dragging the system.....




\section{Out-of-plane buckling}\label{sec:out-of-plane_buckling}
The out-of-plane buckling is one of the motivations for investigating
the application of Kirigami cuts in the context of friction properties. Therefore, we perform a stretch simulation, at low temperature ($T = \SI{5}{K}$) without any substrate, in order to verify that we can reproduce an out-of-plane buckling with the Tetrahedron and Honeycomb patterns intended for our study (see ~\cref{chap:system}). For this investigation we consider the Tetrahedron $(7,5,1)$ and the Honeycomb $(2,2,1,5)$ pattern in comparison to the non-cut sheet. We quantify the out-of-plane buckling by assessing the distribution of atoms along the z-direction (perpendicular to the plane) during stretching. We calculate the
minimum and maximum z-value as well as the atom count quartiles 1\%, 10\%, 25\%, 50\% (median), 75\%, 90\% and 99\% as shown in~\cref{fig:buckling_quartiles}. The results show significant buckling for the Tetrahedron and Honeycomb patterns in comparison to the non-cut sheet which only exhibits minor
buckling of $\sim \SI{2}{\text{Å}}$ which is on the same order as the lattice spacing. Moreover, we notice that the Tetrahedron pattern buckles more in consideration to the min.\ and max.\ peaks while the remaining quantiles seem to be more closely spaced than for the Honeycomb. By addressing the simulation results visually, using the \textit{Open Visualization Tool OVITO}, we find that this can be attributed to fringes on the edge ``flapping around'' and thus increasing the min.\ and max.\ values.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/baseline/vacuum_normal_buckling.pdf}
  \caption{Out-of-plane buckling during stretching of the No cut, Tetrahedron $(7,5,1)$ and Honeycomb $(2,2,1,5)$ sheet resepctively in vacuum at low temperature $T = \SI{5}{K}$. The buckling is measured by the distribution of the atom z-position (perpendicular to the sheet plane), for which the colors indicates selected quantiles. The yield strain were, reading from left to right, 0.38, 0.22 and 1.37.}
  \label{fig:buckling_quartiles}
\end{figure}

Given the confirmation of out-of-plane buckling in a vacuum, as seen in~\cref{fig:buckling_quartiles}, we reintroduce the substrate in order to
investigate whether this effect carries over to a changing contact area. For this simulation we raise the temperature to the default value of $T =\SI{300}{K}$. We keep the normal force off and let the sheet stick purely by the adhesion forces between the sheet and substrate. We quantify the contact area through the relative
amount of atoms in the sheet within chemical range of the substrate. The cut-off
for this interaction is set to 4 Å, inspired by \cite{li_evolving_2016},
corresponding to $\sim 120\%$ the \acrshort{LJ} equilibrium distance. Usually, the contact area is calculated as the number of contacting atoms multiplied by an
associated area for each atom. However, since we are not interested in the
absolute value of the area, but rather the relative change, we omit the
multiplication factor. That is, we consider the relative number of atoms within
the contact range, which is proportional to the contact area, as our metric of
choice. The relative contact for the three configurations (No cut, Tetrahedron
$(7,5,1)$ and Honeycomb $(2,2,1,5)$) during strecthing are shown in figure
\cref{fig:contact_vs_stretch}. The figure reveals a significant drop in contact
as the sheets are stretched, which agrees qualitatively with the buckling
observed in~\cref{fig:buckling_quartiles} without the substrate. The Honeycomb
pattern turns out to be both the most stretchable, with a rupture strain of 1.27, and the one with the biggest decrease in relative contact with a minimum of approximately 43\%. Notice, that the relative contact is never
actual 1.0 but instead reaches a maximum of 96\% with no stretching. This is
attributed to the temperature fluctuations and the choice of cut-off. Thus we might 

Selected frames from the simulation result are shown in~\cref{sec:sheet_stretch}
which reveals a bit more information on how the buckling occurs. The Tetrahedron pattern deforms rather quickly and smoothly into small tetrahedron
spikes, as the name suggests. In the Honeycomb pattern, on the other hand, the
deformations initiate from one side first. As the sheet stretches more rows of
the pattern are activated, producing the honeycomb-looking shape when seen from
above. Both patterns exhibit a small increase in relative contact when they
are approaching their yield strain, which agrees with the results from ~\cref{fig:buckling_quartiles} where the buckling reduces slightly towards the
rupture strain.

\section{Investigating default parameters}\label{sec:main_params}
We carry out a more extensive investigation of the friction dependence on temperature $T$, sliding speed $v_{\text{slide}}$, spring
constant $K$, and timestep $dt$. This is done partly to
understand how the dependencies relate to the theoretical, numerical and
experimental results, and partly to understand how these parameters affect
the stability of our system. We use the default parameters presented in
\cref{tab:final_param} and investigate the results as we change parameters, one at a time. We keep the load at \SI{1}{nN}. We consider the mean
friction force, sampled from the last half of the simulation as described in~\cref{sec:fric_metrics}, representing the kinetic friction. The results are shown in \cref{fig:main_param}, where the shaded area (connected linearly) denotes the absolute error defined by the \acrshort{std} as described in~\cref{sec:fric_metrics}.

\end{figure}

From the temperature investigation in~\cref{fig:var_temp} we find an increasing
kinetic friction with temperature for both the non-cut sheet and the Honeycomb
pattern. The Tetrahedron pattern shows both decreasing and increasing trends. The general trend shows a convex curve in the range (30--480 K) with a minimum around our default choice of \SI{300}{K}, but with rapid fluctuations at the start (10--30 K) and end region (480--500 K). Similar fluctuations are also seen from the Honeycomb pattern, although it shows an underlying increasing trend throughout. When comparing the non-cut sheet and the Honeycomb pattern we observe that the slope for the increasing trend is high for the Honeycomb. From a theoretical and experimental point of view, we would expect a decrease in friction with temperature (see~\cref{sec:prev_results}). However, an increasing trend is also observed in other \acrshort{MD} simulation, for instance by Zhang et al.
\cite{ma12091425} sliding at \SI{10}{m/s}, which is attributed to the high sliding speed associated with the ballistic motion. The default choice is initially based on the common choice of using the temperature $T = \SI{300}{K}$. The non-cut and Tetrahedon friction seems to be rather stables around that point, but we do see some significant fluctuations for the Honeycomb pattern in this range. However, we do not regard this as a critical feature.

From the sliding speed investigation in \cref{fig:var_vel} we generally find increasing friction with velocity. Due to the relatively high velocities used and the effects from the thermostat, we expect a viscous friction $F_k \propto v_{\text{sliding}}$ which matches rather well with these results. However, the Tetrahedron and Honeycomb sheets seem to fall slightly into a sublinear relationship as it approaches higher velocities. Furthermore, these sheets display indications of local fluctuations that could potentially be attributed to resonance effects, as discussed in relation to the phonon dynamics. Our choice of sliding speed at \SI{20}{m/s} mainly reflects a consideration of computational cost, but the fact that no immediate resonance fluctuations appear in the proximity of this value supports the choice.  

From the investigation of the spring constant parameter in~\cref{fig:var_K} we observe a significant decrease in friction as the springs stiffen. This can be attributed to the transition from a stick-slip influenced regime to a smooth sliding regime as we saw for the force traces in~\cref{fig:drag_Ff}. For soft springs the results are quite sensitive to the specific choice of spring constant which is especially seen for the non-cut sheet around $K = \SI{40}{N/m}$. Thus, in order to avoid this domain we settled for the infinitely stiff spring. This is also considered a more favorable option due to its ability to provide greater standardization of the simulations.

Finally, we consider the numerical stability of the result as we vary the
simulation timestep in~\cref{fig:var_dt}. The general trend shows a stable
plateau below $\sim \SI{1.5}{fs}$ for which higher values show signs of arising
instabilities for the cut sheets (Tetrahedron and Honeycomb). This mainly
confirms that our choice of timestep is within a reasonable range. However, we
do see some fluctuations which are more significant for the cut sheets.

The observed fluctuations suggest that randomness plays a role in our simulations and also indicate that the cut sheets are relatively unstable. Further investigation through varying the random seed for the initial velocity and thermostat could shed more light on this matter. In the meantime, we may consider these fluctuations as a sign that the uncertainty in our results is higher than what was estimated using the running mean and running \acrshort{std} evaluation For the Honeycomb sheet, these fluctuations are on the order $\pm \SI{0.017}{nN}$ 



\subsection{Computational cost}
We run the simulations on a CPU cluster made available by the University of Oslo. This allows us to run multiple simulations at once and with each simulation running in parallel on multiple CPU cores as well. As we decide on the simulation parameters we must also consider the computational cost. When selecting simulation parameters, we also need to keep in mind the computational cost. Given that the chosen parameters will be applied to multiple simulations, any increase in computational time will be multiplied by the number of intended simulations, which is expected to be around 10,000. The computational cost is especially dependent on the timestep and the sliding speed as this will affect the number of computations. As an extension of the analysis in \cref{sec:main_params} we
report on the computational times associated with temperature, sliding speed,
spring constant and dt. By retrieving the computational time used for the
parameter investigation in \cref{fig:main_param} we get the timing as shown in
\cref{fig:comp_cost}. Note that these timings are only based on a single simulation for each parameter as opposed to an average over multiple runs which is
nessecary for more reliable data.

    \label{fig:comp_cost}
\end{figure}

The computational time is governed by the number of timesteps in the simulation
and the time used per timestep. For a fixed sliding distance, the number of timesteps in the simulation are inversely proportional
to sliding speed and similar inversely proportional to timestep $dt$. From the
timings in \cref{fig:comp_cost} we find the sliding speed to obey this
expectation rather well by $t \propto v^{-0.977 \pm 0.005}$ while the timing did
not increase as strongly with timestep, falling below the $1/dt$ relation with $t
\propto \text{dt}^{-0.87\pm 0.02}$. Moreover, we find that increasing
temperature also makes for an increased computation time. This can be attributed
to an increase in the computation time associated with the force calculations. The
rising temperature gives rise to more fluctuations in the system which might
yield more atoms within the force calculation cutoffs for each computation. This kind of consideration can also be attributed to the reason for the deviating timing for $dt$. Finally, for the spring parameter, we did not see any noticable effect on timing.


In general, we have selected our simulation parameters: temperature, sliding speed, spring constant, and timestep, based on numerical stability
and computational cost. For the timestep, we found that a value of \SI{1}{fs},
commonly used in similar studies \cite{liu_high-speed_2014, zhu_study_2018},
produced stable results while higher values were prone to instabilities and
lower values were computationally expensive. The sliding speed was chosen primarily based on computational cost, with a default value of \SI{20}{m/s} being a reasonable compromise between computational efficiency and the lower values more commonly used in other studies. Although a lower sliding speed could lead to more commonly observed stick-slip motion, it represents a factor of 20 increase in computational time. Since stick-slip motion is out of reach based on the chosen sliding speed, we found that using an infinitely stiff spring $K = \infty$ was the most reasonable option to ensure stable results. Finally, the temperature investigation did not provide much guidance for a specific choice, so we settled for the standard choice of room temperature $T = \SI{300}{K}$.



\section{Load and stretch dependencies}\label{sec:load_and_stretch}
So far, we have carried out a general analysis of the system behavior under the influence of various simulation parameters. This lays the foundation for the remaining study as we now shift our intention towards the friction dependence of strain and load.

\subsection{Pressure reference for normal load}
We consider a load range of 0.1--\SI{10}{nN} which coincide with the general investigated range in other \acrshort{MD} studies~\cite{li_evolving_2016, zhu_study_2018, zhu_study_2018}. In order to relate the magnitude of this load we provide a short calculation of the corresponding pressure. We will use the pressure underneath a stiletto-heeled shoe as a high-pressure reference from our macroscale perspective. The diameter of a stiletto-heeled
shoe can be less than \SI{1}{cm}~\cite{stiletto_1}, and hence an \SI{80}{kg} man\footnote{Yes, a man can certainly
wear stiletto heels.} standing on one stiletto heel, with all the weight on the heel, will correspond to a pressure
\begin{align*}
  P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{mg}{r^2\pi} = \frac{\SI{80}{kg} \cdot \SI{9.8}{\frac{m}{s^2}}}{(\frac{\SI{e-2}{m}}{2})^2 \pi} = \SI{9.98}{MPa}.
\end{align*} 
The fact that the pressure under a stiletto heel can get this high, actually greater than the pressure under an elephant foot, is an interesting realization in itself that is often used in
introductory physics courses~\cite{stiletto_2}, but this also serves as a reasonable upper bound for human executed pressure. With
a full sheet area of $\sim\SI{21e3}{{\text{Å}}^2}$ our load range of 0.1--\SI{10}{nN} corresponds to a pressure of 0.47--\SI{47}{MPa} which relates nicely to our macroscale reference. This pressure might be incompatible with various industrial purposes, but with no specific application in mind, this serves as a decent reference point. Notice, that if we consider a human foot with area \SI{113}{cm^2}~\cite{stiletto_3} the pressure drops to a mere \SI{70}{kPa} corresponding to only $\sim \SI{0.01}{nN}$.


\subsection{Strain dependency}\label{sec:stretch_dependency}
We consider the effects of stretching the sheet using the non-cut, Tetrahedron $(7,5,1)$ and Honeycomb $(2,2,1,5)$ sheet as used so far. For each configuration, we run a rupture test where the given sheet is stretched under zero load, but still under the influence of adhesion from the substrate. The rupture strain is then recorded, and multiple new simulations are initiated with strain values between zero and the rupture strain. For the sampling of the stretch values in the available range, we use a pseudo-uniform distribution, meaning that we divide the given interval into equal segments and pick a value from each segment by a uniform
distribution. This is due to numerical limitations in LAMMPS\footnote{In LAMMPS, we sample the various strain values by storing restart files during the straining of the sheet. The restart values are stored at specific timesteps governed by a LAMMPS variable. Such variables allow for a vector of uniform randomly chosen values, but unfortunately, we are not able to sort the vector for ascending values. This will lead to the script waiting to store each restart file according to the timesteps in the unsorted vector. As soon as the next timestep value is less than the current timestep the program will stop producing restart files and thus skip most of them. However, by first defining a series of intervals we can draw a uniform number for each interval without getting into trouble.}, but we find that this gives evenly spaced values which also carry some randomness. For the load we use 0.1, 1 and \SI{10}{nN}.

First, we aim to reproduce the contact investigation from~\cref{fig:contact_vs_stretch}. We quantify the relative contact as described in~\cref{sec:out-of-plane_buckling}, but we convert this into a single metric for a given simulation by considering the average of the last 50\% of data points, similar
to what we have done for the mean friction. We also adopt a similar method for quantifying the error (see~\cref{sec:fric_metrics}). The results are shown
in~\cref{fig:contact_vs_stretch} where we observe a significant decrease in
relative contact for the kirigami patterns which qualitatively agrees with the non-loaded continuous stretch simulation in~\cref{fig:contact_vs_stretch}. This result implies that the change in contact is not governed by a momentum effect during stretching, as each simulation now keeps the strain constant throughout the simulation. The absolute error for the mean rel.\ contact was generally quite low on the order of $0.01$ for all configurations. 

From an asperity theory point of view, this reduction in contact is theorized to
induce a similar reduction in friction. However, when considering the kinetic
friction in~\cref{fig:multi_stretch_mean_fric} we find that this is not the
case. For the Tetrahedron and Honeycomb patterns, we find that the friction
initially increases with a decreasing contact area. Yet, these are not simply
inversely proportional as the friction force suddenly dips down and up again, in
the strain range of 0.08--0.11 for the Tetrahedron and 0.73--1.05 for the
Honeycomb pattern. When considering the non-cut sheet, we find that both the
contact area and friction remain seemingly unaffected by strain. This indicates
that the contact area is not a dominating mechanism for friction in our system,
but the underlying mechanism might make for a correlation between a decreasing
contact area and the non-linear friction-strain curve observed here. The latter
point can be supported by the fact that the contact-strain and friction-strain
curve both show signs of a discontinuous jump around a strain of 0.32. Since the
non-cut sheet exhibits a flat friction-strain profile we cannot attribute the
behavior to an increased tension either. The friction effect of tension of a
graphene sheet has been investigated by Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang_tuning_2019}.
However, they report a decreasing friction with tension which qualitatively
contradicts our observation as the direction of the effect is opposite. Instead,
we might point to a commensurability effect or perhaps a change in the
structural stiffness which is reported as an important feature by
\cite{Kim_2012}. We observe that the initial friction value of the non-strained
sheet varies across configurations, with the initial friction increasing from
the non-cut sheet, through the Tetrahedron sheet, to the Honeycomb sheet. This
is more evident from the parameter investigation from~\cref{fig:main_param}, but the size of this effect is within a range on the order of $[0.01, 0.1]$ nN.
We notice also that the two orders of magnitude increase in normal load did not
make a significant difference in the results. The estimated absolute error
marked by a shaded area in~\cref{fig:multi_stretch_mean_fric} were fairly low
for both friction on the order \SI{e-3}{nN} and relative contact on the order of
\num{e-4}.

By considering the increase in friction from zero strain towards the first peak
of the friction-strain curve we find that the Tetrahedron pattern exhibits a
relative friction increase of $\sim 27.7$ while the Honeycomb pattern exhibits a
relative increase of $\sim 22.4$. This is in itself a remarkable result, but
considering that the friction drops almost as dramatically afterward makes for
an even more unexpected behavior. For the Tetrahedron sheet the friction drops by
$\sim \SI{0.51}{nN}$ during an increased strain $\Delta \varepsilon \sim 0.04$
while Honeycomb drops $\sim\SI{0.98}{nN}$ during a strain increase of $\Delta \varepsilon \sim 0.36$. These results are promising for the aim of demonstrating a negative friction coefficient for a system with coupled load and stretch. We will discuss this further at the end of this chapter in~\cref{sec:neg_prospects}.


% get a relative friction increase and increase vs. stretch ratios as described in \cref{tab:first_peak_stretch}. While the honeycomb force increase towards the first peak is approximately linear the popup exhibits seemingly exponential growth which yield a slope on the order $\sim \SI{30}{nN}$.

% Additionally, we notice that booth the popup and honeycomb also exhibits stretch ranges where the kinetic friction force decrease with increasing stretch. Qualitatively we assign the slope to be on the same order of magnitude as those towrds the first peak. This is useful for the prospect of taking advantage of this phenonama as we can essentially achieve booth higher and lower friction for increasing stretch for different starting points. 


\subsection{Load dependency}\label{sec:load_dependency}
From the investigation of the stretch dependency we saw that increasing the normal load from 0.1 to \SI{10}{nN} did not make a considerable impact on the friction in comparison to the effect associated with strain. One special feature of our system is that we only apply load to the pull blocks, and thus one might suspect this to be of importance. Therefore, we investigate the friction under varying loads for a non-cut sheet comparing the case of loading the pull block against a more traditional uniform loading of the sheet as shown in~\cref{fig:load_dist}. Both load distributions show a seemingly non-dependent relationship between friction and load considering the size of our estimated error. Nonetheless, we do not see any indications that the uniform loading changes the qualitative behavior.

     \label{fig:load_dist}
\end{figure}

In order to further investigate the friction dependency of normal load for the Kirigami patterns as they are stretched, we select a subset of stretch stages from ~\cref{fig:multi_stretch_mean_fric} and perform additional simulations with a logarithmically increasing normal load in the extended load range 0.1--\SI{100}{nN}, using 30 load data points for each strain. The results are shown in~\cref{fig:load_dependency}. When spanning three orders of magnitude for the normal load we find some increase in friction with load. This goes for all
patterns, but it is only really visible for the non-cut sheet as the values on the friction axis show a more narrow range. Notice that the load is plotted for a logarithmic axis which makes any seemingly linear trends on the figure 
sublinear. However, as the normal load approaches \SI{100}{nN} we do start to see an increase that is more reminiscent of a linear relationship, but this is difficult to judge given that the change in friction is small in comparison to the noise in the data. Note that we omitted the error bars for visual purposes but they are on the same order of magnitude as shown in \cref{fig:load_dist}.


\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/baseline/multi_FN_mean_compare.pdf}
  \caption{Mean friction force vs.\ load in the range 0.1--100 nN, for the non-cut, Tetrahedron $(7,5,1)$ and Honeycomb $(2,2,1,5)$ sheet resepctively, at different stretch stages relative to their rupture point. }
  \label{fig:load_dependency}
\end{figure}

From the friction measurements in \cref{fig:load_dependency} we see that the
non-cut sheet generally produces a friction force in the order of 0.005--\SI{0.0025}{nN} throughout the 0.1--\SI{100}{nN} load range. Using a ratio based friction coefficient definition \cref{eq:mu_def1}, $\mu_1 = F_{\text{fric}}/{F_N}$, this would lead to a coefficient roughly in the range
\begin{align*}
  &\mu_1,  \ \text{\cref{eq:mu_def1}:}& &\text{No cut}\sim [\num{e-4}, 0.13],&  &\text{Tetrahedron}\sim [\num{4e-4},8.7],& &\text{Honeycomb}\sim [\num{9e-4}, 15.2].&
\end{align*}
However, these values mainly reflect the poorness of this definition, as we find the values to diverge at low load and decrease towards high load due to the lacking linear relationship and an offset in the load curve corresponding to a finite friction at zero load. This offset is drastically enhanced for the Kirigami patterns under strain. Due to the small changes in friction compared to the noise in the data, it is not sensible to calculate the slope $dF_{\text{fric}}/dF_N$ as a function of load. Nonetheless, if we force a linear fit for the whole range and use the second definition \cref{eq:mu_def2} as $\langle \mu_2 \rangle = \Delta F_{\text{fric}}/\Delta F_N$, we get average coefficients in the range
\begin{align*}
  &\mu_2,  \ \text{\cref{eq:mu_def2}:}& &\text{No cut} \sim [4, 9]\times \num{e-5},&  &\text{Tetrahedron} \sim 5\times[\num{e-5}, \num{e-4}],& &\text{Honeycomb} \sim [1,9]\times \num{e-4},&
\end{align*}
depending on the strain values. These numbers should be interpreted cautiously,
but we can take it as a rough estimate of the friction coefficient being on
the order \num{e-4}--\num{e-5}. This relates to the finding by
\cite{DIENWIEBEL2005197} who reported a seemingly non-existing relationship
between friction and normal load with change in friction that corresponds to friction coefficients in the range \num{e-3}--\num{e-4} when using the slope definition \cref{eq:mu_def2}. This supports the idea that the graphene sheet does in fact exhibit superlubric behavior in these conditions. Moreover, the fact that the increase with load is relatively unaffected by the stretching points to the fact that the strain-induced effect mainly shifts the load curve towards higher friction but does not significantly alter its slope. 


\subsection{Prospects of a negative friction coefficient}\label{sec:neg_prospects}

Considering the results from~\cref{sec:stretch_dependency} and~\cref{sec:load_dependency} we find that strain-induced friction effects, on the order of $/SI{1}{nN}$, are generally dominating in comparison to load-induced effects on the order of \SI{0.01}{nN} given a load range of \SI{e2}{nN}. This is promising for the idea of achieving a negative friction coefficient for a nanomachine system that couples load and strain. By applying load on the nanomachine we would increase both the load and the strain on the sheet simultaneously. However, since the friction dependency to strain dominates in comparison to load effects such a system can be designed entirely by considering the strain dependency. The friction coefficient is by our definition (\cref{eq:mu_def2}) given as the slope of the friction $F_f$ vs.\ normal force $F_N$ curve. Hence, for two points $\{(F_{N,1}, F_{f,1}), (F_{N,2}, F_{f,2})\}$, $F_{N,1} < F_{N,2}$ we can evaluate the associated friction coefficient $\mu_{1,2}$ as 
\begin{align*}
  \mu_{1,2} = \frac{F_{f,2} - F_{f,1}}{F_{N,2} - F_{N,1}} = \frac{\Delta F_f}{\Delta F_N}.
\end{align*}
If we neglect load effects $F_f(F_N, \varepsilon) \sim F_f(\varepsilon)$ and consider a coupling $\varepsilon = R F_N$ with linear coupling ratio $R$ we get 
\begin{align}
  \mu_{1,2}(\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2) = \frac{\Delta F_{f}(\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2)}{\frac{1}{R}(\varepsilon_2 - \varepsilon_1)} = R\frac{\Delta F_{f}(\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2)}{\Delta \varepsilon}.
  \label{eq:mu_strain}
\end{align}
When considering the ratios found for the reduction in friction with strain for the Tetrahedron and Honeycomb patterns in~\cref{sec:stretch_dependency} we find the corresponding coupled system friction coefficients to be 
\begin{align}
  &\text{Tetrahedron:} \quad R\frac{-\SI{0.51}{nN}}{0.04} = -R\cdot\SI{12.75}{nN},& &\text{Honeycomb:} \quad R\frac{-\SI{0.98}{nN}}{0.36} = -R\cdot\SI{2.72}{nN}&
  \label{eq:pilot_study_mu_estimate}
\end{align}
This showcases that we might be able to utilize the strain effect to achieve a negative friction for the system of coupled strain and load
