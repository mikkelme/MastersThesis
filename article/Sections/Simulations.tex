\hl{Consider relabeling drag length to sliding distance instead.}

\subsection{Friction simulation parameters}

The friction simulation is governed by a set of parameters where some is kept constant while other is varied to gain insight in the frictional properties. These parameters can be categorised into three main categories of different purpose as described in table \ref{tab:param}. 


\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{center}
  \caption{Parameters of the numerical procedure for measuring friction.}

    Physical & 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] $T$: Temperature for the Langevin thermostat.
      \item[-] $v_{\text{slide}}$ : Sliding speed for the sheet translation.
      \item[-] $K$: Spring constant for the spring force between the virtual atom and the pull blocks responsible for translating the sheet along the substarte. An infinte spring constant is achieved by moving the pull blocks as a rigid body (Lammps: fix move).
      \item[-] Scan angle: The direction for which we translate the sheet.
    \end{itemize} &
    Parameters expected to have a physical effect on the friction properties, which is kept fixed and thus not included in the machine learning input set.

Due to the great number of parameters, and corresponding range of reasonable numerical values they can take, it is ... to parameter search including all of these. Thus, we will to a great extent rely on a reverse engineering in order to establish a set of parameters for the \textit{physical} and \textit{measurement} categories along with numerical ranges for the $\textit{ML input}$ category which gives stable and promising results. By doing so we effectively narrow down the parameter regime for which the investigated frictional properties belong. We aim to chose the parameters in order to accomodate a balance between generlizable and stable result which is simmutaneously a suting candidate as a proof of concept for the control of friction properties using kirigami inspired cuts. 

In the following we present the results of the friction simulations in parallel to the procedure of investigating the choice of different parameters. 

In the following subsections (X to Y) we are going to present the friction simulation results in parallel to the presentation of the reasoning behind the parameter choices. For this we will refer to the default parameter choice showcased in table \ref{tab:final_param} which is representative of the final parameter choices.

Say someting about how these parameters is chosen. Reference to articles for which these was mirrored from. 


% Which articles is used as a reference for choosing these variables?


% The sliding velocity is 20 m/s, which is comparable to the operating conditions in micromechanical systems (MEMS), but which is much larger than the typical velocity in scanning force microscopy (SFM) experiments. \cite{mo_friction_2009} Supplementary materials.


% We should try to set the physcis and measurement parameters in such a way that we reduce computation speed where it is doesn't infer with the frictional properties study.

% We need to define some ranges for the ML input paramters. $F_N$, stretch ranges where it is not prone to ruptures. The configuration it self does not have clear rules but is also being regulated by the no rupture requirement. 

% Retardation effects due to the finiteness of the speed of sound are usually irrelevant in slow-speed experiments (v < 1 mm/s) \cite{Manini_2016}

% In macroscopic tribology experiments, sliding speeds often range in the 0.1 − 10 m/s region \cite{Manini_2016}

% By contrast, in nanoscale AFM experiments the tip usually advances at much lower speeds $\sim$ 1 $\mu$m/s: over a typical run it is possible to simulate a tiny ∼ 1 pm displacement, far too small to explore even a single atomic-scale event, let alone averaging over a steady state.\cite{Manini_2016}


% However, MD simulations can provide so much physical insight that they make sense even if carried out at much higher speeds than in real-life AFM or surface force apparatus (SFA) experiments: in practice, currently the sliding speeds of most atomistic tribology simulations are in the $\sim$ 1 m/s region.\cite{Manini_2016}


% Besides the limitations of system size and simulation times that are obvious and will be discussed later, there is another limitation concerning temperature, that is rarely mentioned. All classical frictional simulations, atomistic or otherwise, are only valid at sufficiently high temperature. They become in principle invalid at low temperatures where the mechanical degrees of freedom of solids progressively undergo ”quantum freezing”, and both mechanics and thermodynamics deviate from classical. \cite{Manini_2016}.


\subsubsection{Pressure reference for normal load domain}
\text{Find place to put this.}

In order to relate the magntidue of the normal force in our friciton measurement
we will use the pressure as a reference. We will use the pressure underneath a
stiletto shoe as a worst case for human pressure execuation underneath the
shoes. From (source 1) it is reported that the diameter of a stiletto heeled
shoe can be less than 1 cm. Hence a 80 kg man\footnote{Yes, a man can certainly
wear stilleto heels.} standing on one stiletto heel (with all the weight on the
heel) will result in a pressure
\begin{align*}
  P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{mg}{r^2\pi} = \frac{\SI{80}{kg} \cdot \SI{9.8}{\frac{m}{s^2}}}{(\frac{\SI{1e-2}{m}}{2})^2 \pi} = \SI{9.98}{MPa} \\
\end{align*} 

% source 1:
% https://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/age16-19/Mechanics/Statics/text/Pressure_/index.html
While this is in itself a spectacular realization that is often used in
introductory physics courses (source 2) to demonstrate the rather extreme
pressure under a stiletto heel (greater than the foot of an elephant) (how many
Atmos?) this serves as a reasonible upperbound for human executed pressure. With
a full sheet area of $\sim\SI{21e3}{Å^2}$ we can achieve a similar pressure of
$\sim \SI{10}{MPA}$ with a normal force of
\begin{align*}
  F_N = \SI{10}{MPa} \cdot \SI{21e-17}{m^2} = \SI{2.10}{nN}  
\end{align*}

Of course this pressure might be insufficient for various industrial purposes,
but with no specific procedure in mind this serves as a decent reference point.
Notice that if we consider a human foot with ares $\SI{113}{cm^2}$ the pressure
drops to a mere $\SI{70}{kPa}$ corresponding to $\sim \SI{0.01}{nN}$.

\subsection{Single friction simulation analysis}
We begin by assessing the raw data for a single friction simulation run with the default parameters shown in table \ref{tab:final_param} for a non-cut sheet, no stretch and an applied normal force of $\SI{1}{nN}$.


\subsubsection{Force oscillations}
We first assess the raw data for the friction force $F_{\parallel}$ parallel to the drag direction as seen in figure \ref{fig:drag_Ff}. The sample rate is 10 ps$^{-1}$ = 100 timesteps$^{-1}$ for which each sample is the mean value of the 100 timesteps preceding the given sample interval. We observe immediately that the data carriers oscillations on different time scales. By applying a savgol filter to the data with a polyorder of 5 and window length of 150 timesteps, corresponding to a sliding distance of 3 Å or a time window of 15 ps, we can qualitatively point out at least two different frequencies of osccilation. On figure \ref{fig:drag_Ff_10} we see roughly three waves on the savgol filter corresponding to a relative high frequency, while on \ref{fig:drag_Ff_100} the same savgol filter reveals a lower frequency on top of the first, creating the visual pattern of a wavepacket.

  \hfill
     \caption{Friction force $F_\parallel$ with respect to the drag direction between (full) sheet and substrate versus sliding distance. The sliding distance is measured by the constant movement of the virtual atom and not the COM of the sheet. However, we expect these measures to be fairly identical due the fact that the pull blocks is rigidly coupled to the virtual atom. The red line represents a savgol filter with window polyorder 5 and window length of 150 timesteps (corresponding to a sliding distance of 3 Å or a time window of 15 ps).}
     \label{fig:drag_Ff}
\end{figure}

By performing a Fourier Transform (FT) on the data we can quantify the leading frequencies as seen in figure \ref{fig:ft_a}. By plotting the two most dominant frequencies $f_1 = 0.0074$ ps$^{-1}$ and $f_2 = 0.0079$ ps$^{-1}$ as $\sin{(2\pi f_1)} + \sin{(2\pi f_2)}$ we find a qualitatively convincing fit to the observed wavepacket shape as seen in figure \ref{fig:ft_b}. By using the trigonometric identity
\begin{align*}
\sin (\alpha+\beta) &= \sin (\alpha) \cos (\beta) + \cos (\alpha) \sin (\beta), \\
\sin (\alpha-\beta) &= \sin (\alpha) \cos (\beta) - \cos (\alpha) \sin (\beta),
\end{align*}
and decomposing $f_1 = a - b$, $f_2 = a + b$ we can rewrite the sine sum as the sinusoidal product
\begin{align*}
  \sin(2\pi f_1) \sin(2\pi f_2) &= \sin\big(2\pi (a - b)\big) \sin\big(2\pi (a + b)\big) \\
  &= \sin(a)\cos(b) + \cancel{\cos(2\pi a)\sin(2\pi b)} + \sin(2\pi a)\cos(2\pi b) - \cancel{\cos(2\pi a)\sin(2\pi b)} \\
  &= 2 \sin(2\pi a) \cos(2\pi b),
\end{align*} 

with 
\begin{align*}
  a = \frac{f_1 + f_2}{2} &= 0.0763 \pm \SI{0.0005}{ps^{-1}},& 
  b = \frac{f_2 - f_1}{2} &= 0.0028 \pm \SI{0.0005}{ps^{-1}},& \\
  &= 0.381 \pm \SI{0.003}{Å^{-1}},& 
  &= 0.014 \pm \SI{0.003}{Å^{-1}},& 
\end{align*}
where the latter frequency is denoted with respect to the sliding distance. This makes us recognize the high osccilation frequency as $a$ and the low frequency as $b$. The faster one has a period of $T_a = 2.62 \pm 0.02$ Å\footnote{The uncertainty $\Delta y$ is calculated as $\Delta y = \left|\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \Delta x \right|$ for uncertainty $\Delta x$ and $y(x)$}. This corresponds well with the magnitude of the lattice spacing and especialy that of graphene at 2.46 Å as expected theoretically (make reference to theory section?). We also take note of the longest period $T_b = 71 \pm 15$ Å$^{-1}$ which will be relevant for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty in section \ref{sec:def_dyn_and_stat}.

\subsubsection{Decompositions}
In the previous analysis we have looked only at the friction force for the full
sheet, including the pull blocks which is locked off during sliding, and with
respect to the drag direction. This represents our choice measurement which we will adress in the following.

Due to the fact that we are only applying cuts to the inner sheet (excluding the
pull blocks), it might seem more natural to only consider the friction on that
part. If the desired frictional properties can be achieved by altering the inner
sheet one can argue that any opposing effects from the pull blocks can be
mitigated by scaling the relative size between the inner sheet and the pull
blocks. However, when looking at the time series of the friction force
decomposed with respect to the inner sheet and pull block region (see figure
\ref{fig:decomp_group}), we observe the friction force arrising from those parts
are seemingly antisymmetric. That is, the distribution of the fricitonal pull from the substrate on the sheet is
oscillating between the inner sheet and the pull block. Keeping in mind that 
normal force is only applied to the pull blocks we might take this as an
integrated feature of the system which does not nessecary dissapear when changing the spatial ratio between inner sheet and pull block. Any interesting friciton properties might depend on this internal distribution of forces. Hence, we hedge our bets
and use the full sheet friction force as a hollistic approach to this measurement
problem.

Similar we might question the decision of
only considering the frictional force projected onto the sliding direction as
we are neglecting the ``side shift'' induced during the slide phase. In figure \ref{fig:decomp_direc} we see the decomposition into force components parallel $F_{\parallel}$ and perpendicular $F_{\perp}$ to the slide direction respectively. We see that the most dominant trends is projected into the parallel component. If we want to include the perpendicular component as well we would have to evaluate the friction as the length of the force vector for which we would lose the sign of the force direction. Hence, we would only get a positive contributin which would not be able to capture the change between resisting and assisting the sliding during stick-slip motion. One option to accommodate this is by using the vector length but keeping the sign from the projection parallel to the sliding direction. However, we omit such compromises as this might make analysis interpration more difficult, and we use only the parallel component going forward.

\subsubsection{Center of mass path}
From the previous observations we already have evidence of a stick slip behaviour, judging from the friction oscillations in figure \ref{fig:drag_Ff}, and motion partial motion perpendicular to the drag direction, judging from the perpendicular force component in figure \ref{fig:decomp_direc}. By looking at the $x,y$-position for the center of mass (COM) we can see the stick slip motion manifested as a variation in COM speed combinned with a side to side motion as shown in figure $\ref{fig:COM_path_K0}$. To increase this effect we also show the same plot with a spring ... move with spring constant 30 N/m in figure \ref{fig:COM_path_K30}. While the max speed is on the same scale the side to side motion is increased (notice that the axis scale is different between figure \ref{fig:COM_path_K0} and \ref{fig:COM_path_K0}).

\subsection{Defining metrics for dynamic and static friction}\label{sec:def_dyn_and_stat}
We are interested taking the comprehensive friction force time series dataset
and reducing it into single metrics describing the dynamic and static friciton
respectively. The natural choice is to use the mean and max values. 

\subsubsection{Dynamic friction} 
For the dynamic friction measurement we take the mean of the latter half of the data to ensure that the system has
stabilished itself before taking the mean. For a full drag simulation of 400 Å
we would thus base our mean value on the latter 200 Å drag. In figure
\ref{fig:runmean} we have shown the friction force of the first 10 Å of drag
together with a running mean with window length 50\% of the corresponding data
length. The final mean value estimate is indicated with red point at the end and
we clearly observe that the length of sampling is insufficient since we ger a
negative friction force.  Nonetheless, one approach to quanity the uncertainy of
the final mean estimate is to consider the running mean. The more the running
mean fluctuates the more uncertainty is associated with the final estimate. 

% That is, if the running mean is constant it doesn't really matter whether we
% stop early or drag a bit longer. However, any fluctuations of this line means
% that out mean measurement is still sensitive to the drag length and any
% changes in the simulation inducing a phase shift of this oscillations will
% effect the final mean value in unaccountable manner. 

We should not care for flucations in the initial part of the running mean curve
as this is still including data from the beginning, where it might transistion
from static to dynamic friction. Only the running mean ``close'' to the ending
should be considered for our uncertainty. From the Fourier analyse we concluded
that longest period of any dominant oscialltions is $\sim 71$ Å$^{-1}$
corresponding to $\sim 35 \%$ of the running mean window of 200 Å drag. Hence we use use standard deviation of the final 35\% of the running mean curve to approximate the uncertainty of the final mean value. By dividing with the final running mean we effectively calculate the relative error as shown in figure \ref{fig:runstd}. Naturally, we get a relative error of $\sim 257\%$ which corresponds with the mean value taking an unexpected negative value.


\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/baseline/Ff_runmean.pdf}
    \caption{Running mean}
    \label{fig:runmean}
  \end{subfigure}
  \hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/baseline/Ff_runstd.pdf}
      \caption{Running std}
      \label{fig:runstd}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Running std}
  \label{fig:running}
\end{figure}

When we include the full 400 Å drag, such that std window actually matches with the longest period of oscillations expected from the data, we get a final relative. error of $\sim 12 \%$ as shown in fig \ref{fig:runstd_long}. This is just at the limit for an acceptable error, but as we shall see later (refer to figure or something) this high error is mainly connected to the cases of low friction. When changing the simulation parameters, such that the mean friction evaluate to considerable higher values, the relative error drops to around (put in numbers). One explanation is that the osccilations in the running mean does not increase linearly with the magnitude of the friction, and hence the relative error might spike especially for the low friction cases. 


\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/baseline/Ff_runstd_long.pdf}
  \caption{...}
  \label{fig:runstd_long}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Static friction} 
The max value is the most obvious choice for adressing the static friction, even though that the definition of the static friction is a bit vague. At least when judging from the raw data in figure \ref{fig:drag_Ff} we not see a textbook example of the static friction precourser  (maybe include a classic static friction curve in the theory... I'm not completely sure what to expect here). Additionally the global max value does not always lie in the initial part of the simulation. \\
For a proper static friction evaluation we should increase force slowly and wait for the slip response. Here we drag quite fast making it diffucult to assess the static response. \\
We investigate the placement of the max values, i.e. the drag length for which we measure the max friction force. We show the placement of the top three max values for different simulatiosn with varying normal force in figure \ref{fig:max_dist}. We observe immediately that only a few top three max values is measured within a full slow period of $\sim$ 71 Å. In fact many max values is measured just before the end of the simulation. This indicates that the naive approach of using the overall max value to describe the static friction coefficient might be a to naive approach. Another approach is to use the max value within a single period, but we do not really know if this period will be similar for alle cut patterns and thus this might be limiting. 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/baseline/max_dist.pdf}
  \caption{Distribution of top 3 max values for different normal force}
  \label{fig:max_dist}
\end{figure}


Look into static friction when having a spring connected to the drag force with
rather low spring constant. Maybe compare to critical sitffness in FK model.
Some rough calculations follow here (make a note about this being a very naive
approach to determine a suitable stiffness for static friction scenarious. In
reality one should increase force slowly to observe this probably). When
dragging the sheet in the y-direction we effectively have a lattice spacing
\begin{align*}
  a_c = a_{2,x} + B_x = a_G\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{a_G}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2a_G}{\sqrt{3}}
\end{align*}
for graphene lattice constant $a_G = 2.46$ Å. For the diamond silicon structure
this is essentially equal to the lattice constant $a_D = 5.4210$ Å. This gives 
\begin{align*}
  \theta = \frac{a_c}{a_b} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\frac{a_G}{a_D} \approx 0.5230.
\end{align*}
Since we have the factor $2/\sqrt{3}$ it is safe to assume that this is a
irrational number leadning to incommensurability. The worst case scnario of
incommensurability (where $\theta$ equals the golden-mean, Can we get the exact
number?) gives the minimal critical stiffness $K_c \sim 2U_0
(\frac{\pi}{a_b})^2$, where $U_0$ is the substrate potentiual magnitude and
$a_b$ the lattice spacing of the substrate. The potential barrier $U_0$ can be
approximated by the work done when resisting the normal force as $\sim F_N
a_D/2$ such that the critical stiffness can be approximated to 
\begin{align*}
  K_c \sim 2 F_N \frac{a_D}{2} \left(\frac{\pi}{a_D}\right)^2 = \frac{F_N}{a_D}\pi^2
\end{align*}
With a normal force of 1 nN we get $K_c \sim 18$ N/m. Hence, we should try a
spring constant lower than that as qualified way of determining if this is the
reason why we do not really see static friciton in the simulation. By plotting the max position (in terms of drag length) as a function of spring constant as seen in figure \ref{fig:max_vs_K} we can investigate if the concept of a critical spring constant is governing this simulation. However, as I'm writing this I'm realizing that the spring constant in the model applies to the interatomic forces and not the one dragging the system.....

We see that the popup and honeycomb pattern buckles considerable out of plane during the stretch while the noncut sheet only experiences minor buckling of $\sim 2$ Å which is on the same scale as the atomic spacing in the sheet. We also notice that the popup pattern experiences buckles more in consideration to the min and max peaks while the 1\%, 99\% quartiles is on the same scale as the honeycomb. By looking at the visualization (include this somewhere) we can conclude that this is mainly due to the fringes of the sheet ``flapping'' around.

Similar test is performaned in the presence of the substrate under a higher temperature $T = 300$ K. We assess the contact area by the relative amount of atoms in the sheet within chemical range of the substrate. The cut-off for this interaction is 4 Å corresponding to $\sim 120$\% the LJ equilibrium distance. Since the contact area is usually calculated as the amout of atoms in contact multiplied with an associated area for each contact this feature is proportional to that.

Simulations of concentric nanotubes in relative motion (telescopic sliding), have revealed the occurrence of well-defined velocities at which friction is enhanced, corresponding to a washboard frequency resonating with longitudinal [172] or circular [173] phonon modes, leading to enhanced energy dissipation. The frictional response becomes highly non-linear while approaching the critical velocity and, contrary to macroscopic systems, washboard resonances can arise at multiple velocities, especially for incommensurate interfaces where more than one length scale may be in common to the contacting surfaces [172] \cite{Manini_2016}.

The friction probably does not increase with normal force at an expected rate due to the fact the normal force is only applied on the pull blocks. Especially with the cutted sheet the tension drops such that the effecive normal force on the inner sheet is not changing so much. By this theory the friction force vs. normal force on the pull graph look a bit more like expected.

When looking at the graphs for the PB the max friction is visually textbook linear, while the mean friction is a bit more linear but also with negativ coefficients.

\subsubsection{Contact area}

Show plots of contact area vs stretch and discuss the fact that friction actually increases while contact area drops. Is the conclusion that there might be another more dominant cause of the increasing friction.

Show how the number of cores per simulation scale to argue that running on just one core (maybe 4) is smart for the next step of many simulations. 

Mention the trouble with GPU to show that this was considered.
