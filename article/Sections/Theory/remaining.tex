Fourier transform is a technique where we transform a function $f(t)$ of time to
a function $F(k)$ of frequency. The Forward Fourier Transform is done as
\begin{align*}
  F(k) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) e^{-2\pi ikx} dx
\end{align*}

For any complex function $F(k)$ we can decompose it into magnitude $A(k)$ and
phase $\phi(k)$
\begin{align*}
  F(k) = A(k) e^{i \phi(k)}
\end{align*}

Hence when performing a Forward Fourier transform on a time series we can
determine the amplitude and phase as a function of freqeuncy as 
\begin{align*}
  A(k) = |F(k)|^2, \qquad \phi(k) = \Im{\ln{F(k)}}
\end{align*}
