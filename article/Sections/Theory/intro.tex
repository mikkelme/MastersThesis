Small introtext to motivate this chapter. What am I going to go over here.


% The friction force is not an independent external force that acts on a body but an internal force that opposes the externally applied force. Thus, it may be thought of as a reaction force rather than an action force. In this sense, it is similar to the adhesion force between two bodies, which appears only when one tries to separate the bodies from contact. \cite{gao_frictional_2004}
